### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. AJAX is a unique tool that allows a client to interact with a server and fetch information quickly, and conveniently. With AJAX, the user does not have o wait for reloading or timely execution of commands. 
2. Even Google uses AJAX. It is evident when google provides users with search suggestions as the user is typing. It is not necessary for the webpage to reload the homepge/google search bar. 
3. JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a syntax for storing and exchanging data. SInce it is a subset of JavaScript, JSON is easy and lightweight to add in and use, and mirrors other conventional programming languages.
